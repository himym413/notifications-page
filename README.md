## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
- Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I was having trouble with overflow while working on mobile design and I spent some time researching what could be causing the problem. However, I learned that Google Chrome can get some type of bug when often switching from mobile to desktop view.
Guess I'll start using Mozilla Firefox a bit more now.
